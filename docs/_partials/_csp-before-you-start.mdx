***MEM: Getting some content from the QS version of this topic will add editorial improvements—like the GH/GL links.***

- GitHub or GitLab account: If you don't already have an account, create a free GitHub account at https://github.com/ or a GitLab account at https://gitlab.com/.

***Second bullet was a duplicate of the clone repo bullet – I removed it***

***With that little bit of info for each CSP, we don't need tabs. It could be “Cloud service provider (CSP) account: Ask your organization administrator (is that the right role?) for access to your organization's AWS or Azure enterprise account." [But "organization" might be a loaded term in the AWS world--need to dig deeper to find out.] Keep the tabs for now. Need to understand better what we really need to tell them. There’s content about a free Azure account in Prepare your CSP account. Would be good to have the basics about getting/accessing the account all in one place.***

***For the repo bullet, can remove “access.” We don’t have to repeat “AI Unlimited GitHub repository” before and after the colon (:). Can say “and clone it.” Let’s put the sentence about what it includes before the sentence about cloning. Then they can go straight to the code.***

***TA: the user need not be worried about all the folders in the repo, in this context they need to know only about the Deployments folder***

***Pretty sure “for deploying” is more grammatically accurate in this case. At the least, it sounds better to my ear (will research someday).*** 

- [Teradata AI Unlimited GitHub](https://github.com/Teradata/ai-unlimited) repository: The **Deployments** folder in the repository contains template, parameter, and policy files for deploying AI Unlimited and JupyterLab on your CSP. Open a terminal window, and clone the repository. 

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Teradata/ai-unlimited
```
