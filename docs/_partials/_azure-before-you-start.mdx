Make sure you have the prerequisites, and take some first steps.

***"first steps" not quite logical in a "Before" topic. Revisit.***

## Prerequisites

- [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com).

- Optionally, the [Azure command-line interface (CLI)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli).

- [GitHub](https://github.com) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) account.

## First steps

- Subscribe to AI Unlimited on the Azure Marketplace ***(link)***. 

***If we include Subcribe here, we would remove the separate Subscribe topic. Might depend on what we really need to say about subscribing. The listing is going to change still. Hoping it is self-evident.***

- Clone Teradata's [AI Unlimited GitHub repository](https://github.com/Teradata/ai-unlimited): The **deployments** folder in the repository contains template, parameter, and policy files for deploying AI Unlimited and JupyterLab on your CSP. Open a terminal window, and clone the repository. 

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/Teradata/ai-unlimited
    ```
  
- When you ***[best words TBD]***, you'll provide details for ***[best words TBD]***. Copy this template to get these details from someone on your organization's cloud neworking and security team. ***What is the best way to describe this team to this audience? "Cloud IT team?" "Cloud operations team"?*** 

    ```bash
    Subscription ID: 
    Resource Group:
    Azure Region: 
    Virtual Network (VNet): 
    Subnet: 
    Network Security Group:
    Load Balancer (ALB/NLB/Not Applicable):
    RoleDefinition Id: 
	```
