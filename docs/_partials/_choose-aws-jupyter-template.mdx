JupyterLab CloudFormation templates are here in the AI Unlimited GitHub repository:

`ai-unlimited/deployments/aws/templates/jupyter/`

1. Choose a template based on whether you intend to use a [load balancer](/docs/glossary.md#glo-load-balancer) and what type.

    - [jupyter-alb.yaml](https://github.com/Teradata/ai-unlimited/blob/develop/deployments/aws/templates/ai-unlimited/ai-unlimited-with-alb.yaml)&mdash;Hosts JupyterLab behind an [application load balancer](/docs/glossary.md#glo-application-load-balancer)
    - [jupyter-with-nlb.yaml](https://github.com/Teradata/ai-unlimited/blob/develop/deployments/aws/templates/ai-unlimited/ai-unlimited-with-nlb.yaml)&mdash;Hosts JupyterLab behind a [network load balancer](/docs/glossary.md#glo-network-load-balancer)
    - [jupyter-without-lb.yaml](https://github.com/Teradata/ai-unlimited/blob/develop/deployments/aws/templates/ai-unlimited/ai-unlimited-without-lb.yaml)&mdash;No load balancer
