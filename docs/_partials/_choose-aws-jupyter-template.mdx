CloudFormation templates for JupyterLab are here in the AI Unlimited GitHub repository you cloned:

`/deployments/aws/templates/jupyter/`

Choose a template based on whether you intend to use a [load balancer](/docs/glossary.md#glo-load-balancer) and what type.

    - `jupyter-alb.yaml`&mdash;Hosts JupyterLab behind an [application load balancer](/docs/glossary.md#glo-application-load-balancer)
    - `jupyter-with-nlb.yaml`&mdash;Hosts JupyterLab behind a [network load balancer](/docs/glossary.md#glo-network-load-balancer)
    - `jupyter-without-lb.yaml`&mdash;No load balancer
