# Collaborate on a project - TEST

**this is WIP**

A project owner might add you to a project as a collaborator. To access the project to contribute, all you need is the project name.

1. Connect to the manager. (%workspaces_config)

2. List the engine details (%project_engine_list)<br/>
   Is the engine deployed? If yes... If no...

3. List the project's users (%project_user_list)
Note your username and password.

4. %project_connection_add?

5. %connect connection name? (from the Teradata SQL kernel?)

Now you can contribute to the project.

:::note
Coordinate with the project owner and collaborators to ensure the engine is deployed, or not deployed (suspended), as needed.
