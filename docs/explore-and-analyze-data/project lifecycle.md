# Project lifecycle

You create, run, and manage projects in a Jupyter notebook using the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel. 

Analytic workloads aside, this is the project lifecycle in terms of what you do:


**Get your API key.**
The first time you log in to the [workspace service] using your credentials for your AI Unlimited Git repo, an API key is generated for you. Log back into [workspace service] any time to copy the key. You'll need it every time you....

**Create the project.**
Provide the API key and your CSP environment variables. What else... Use the magic commands, provided by the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel to run workloads.

code


**Optionally, add users** (supported for [demo](docs\install-ai-unlimited\demo\index.md) and [production](link) installations)

code


**Suspend the project**
When you're done for the time-being, you can suspend the project. You only pay for the time a project is active. [Blah] gets retained so you can resume the project [something like, "in tact"].

code


**Resume the project**
Whenever you like, resume the project.

code


**What else...**
Blah blah

code


**Do they ever remove a project completely?**
Why they might want to... what it means... totally irrecoverable?
