# Project lifecycle

(Figuring out what this should be - maybe a high-level view - maybe as a graphic.)

(The "Create your first project" topic and the notebooks in the "Example projects" topic involve a bit of scrolling and are specific to workloads, so thinking might be good to have a forest, no trees, view.)

(Use color to separate the lifecycle steps from the workload, and to indicate essential vs. optional lifecycle steps?)

You create, run, and manage analytics projects in [Jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) notebooks that have the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel, which provides [AI Unlimited magic commands](/docs/explore-and-analyze-data/magic-commands.md).


**Get your API key**
Sign in to AI Unlimited, and copy your API key.

(image of the key in the UI--to show its location)


**In JupyterLab, add/open/create (?) a notebook**
(Details...)


**Do x, y, and z**
(Details... ip/hostname, API key, tls)


**Create a project**
(Details... name, CSP, team...)


**Deploy the project's engine**
(Details... project name, size)


**Connect**
(Details... project name)


**Run your workload (best way to say that?)** (Different color)
(Details...)


**How to address connecting to data in a generic way?** (Different color)
(Details..)


**Back up project information?**
(Details... Always do before suspending?)


**Suspend the project**
You only pay for the compute resources used when the project is active. So when you're done for the time-being, you can suspend the project. A, B, and C gets retained, so you can resume the project and pick up right where you left off.


**Resume the project**
Whenever you like, resume the project. (What details to include about what this really means? Link to a separate topic? Currently it's under Manage AI Unlimited, but not sure it should stay there.)


**What else is mainstream...**


**Do they ever remove a project completely?**
