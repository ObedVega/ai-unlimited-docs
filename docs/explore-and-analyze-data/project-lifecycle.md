# Project lifecycle

***figuring out what this should be - maybe just a high-level view - maybe as a graphic - "Create your first project" topic and the example projects involve a bit of scrolling and are specific to workloads, so thinking would be good to show the forest (vs. trees) here - wrestling with whether to include code here - could link to specific topics like "Suspend and resume a project"***

You create, run, and manage analytics projects in [Jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) notebooks that use the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel, which provides AI Unlimited magic commands.  ***Is that Jupyter doc a reasonable place to send them?***


**Get your API key.**
The first time you log in to the workspace service using your AI Unlimited Git repository credentials, your API key is generated. Copy it.

***image of the key in workspaces--to show its location there - this is good use of a screenshot, because the user is not necessarily in workspaces now, and we want to point out where this one small thing is on that UI***


**In Jupyter, open a notebook (mention the kernel)**
***What details do they need here?***


**Create the project.**
Provide the API key and the CSP environment variables. ***add how-to details here or no?***

***include the code?***


**Connect to your data**



**Optionally, add collaborators to the project--WHEN? before or after running workload(s)** (supported for [demo](docs\install-ai-unlimited\demo\index.md) and [production](docs\install-ai-unlimited\production\index.md) installations only)

***include the code?***



**Back up project information**
***include the code?***



**Suspend the project**
When you're done for the time-being, you can suspend the project. You only pay for the time a project is active. ABC gets retained so you can resume the project just as it is now.

***include the code?***



**Resume the project**
Whenever you like, resume the project. ***what details to include about what this really means? or, link to a separate topic? Currently it's under Management, but not sure it should stay there.**

***include the code?***



**What else...**



**Do they ever remove a project completely?**
