# The project lifecycle

***will work on this after "Run a Sample Workload" - don't want this to be too redundant with that - was hoping to show here, at-a-glance, what happens in a project - maybe not a good idea - or maybe this does not show any code (that's in the magic command reference in the notebook) - maybe can keep this at a higher level - is there other storytelling about a project that should go here that's not in the the sample workload topic and not in a nb? - re-watch demos]***

You create, run, and manage an analytics project in a Jupyter notebook using the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel and the magic commands it provides. Learn more (link) about Jupyter notebooks ***Maybe something comparable to the Vantage links Thripti included? My current assumption is that Vantage doc links are not ok, but we'll ask.***

Analytic workloads aside, here's the project lifecycle:


**Get your API key.**
The first time you log in to the workspace service using your AI Unlimited Git repository credentials, your API key is generated. Copy it.

***image of the key in workspaces--to show its location there - this is good use of a screenshot, because the user is not necessarily in workspaces now, and we want to point out where this one small thing is on that UI***


**In Jupyter, open a notebook (mention the kernel)**
***What details do they need here?***


**Create the project.**
Provide the API key and the CSP environment variables. ***add how-to details here or no?***

***include the code?***


**Connect to your data**



**Optionally, add collaborators to the project--WHEN? before or after running workload(s)** (supported for [demo](docs\install-ai-unlimited\demo\index.md) and [production](docs\install-ai-unlimited\production\index.md) installations only)

***include the code?***



**Back up project information**
***include the code?***



**Suspend the project**
When you're done for the time-being, you can suspend the project. You only pay for the time a project is active. ABC gets retained so you can resume the project just as it is now.

***include the code?***



**Resume the project**
Whenever you like, resume the project. ***what details to include about what this really means? or, link to a separate topic? Currently it's under Management, but not sure it should stay there.**

***include the code?***



**What else...**



**Do they ever remove a project completely?**
