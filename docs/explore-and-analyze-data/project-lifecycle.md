# Project lifecycle

AI Unlimited provides [magic commands](/docs/explore-and-analyze-data/magic-commands.md) for creating and managing projects in Jupyter notebooks. 

If you create a project, you are its owner. Once a project is created, your Git repository owner can [add collaborators](/docs/manage-ai-unlimited/add-collaborators.md) to the project in the repository. In the notebook, you'll need to update the engine for those new users. 

You might be the owner of one or more projects and a collaborator on others. While owners and collaborators can use the same magic commands, their project involvement is typically different.
