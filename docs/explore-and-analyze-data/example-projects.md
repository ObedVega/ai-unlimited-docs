# Sample use cases


**This is WIP.**

Intro...

## Large language models (LLMs) for customer segmentation

Use word embeddings and clustering algorithms to discover ideal customer segments. You can experiment with advanced AI and ML techniques to quickly find the ideal number of customer segments, based on the semantic meaning of customer comment history. Use your results for marketing and other tasks, or for further predictive analytics.

### Vector embedding

A numerical representation of data that captures semantic relationships and similarities. It enables you to perform mathematical operations and comparisons&mdash;for text analysis and recommendation systems.

### K-means clustering

An often-used unsupervised machine learning algorithm. It groups similar data points together by minimizing the average (the "means" in K-means) distance for all data points from each cluster's center (centroid).

### What you'll do

With customer comment data we provide, you'll...

1. Create a vector embedding table using open-source LLMs.

2. Run multiple experiments in parallel.

3. Visualize the results to see the best cluster **(cluster or segment?)**.

## Financial services customer journey (using what?)

Financial customers interact with many in-person and digital platforms, including websites and other online interfaces **(meaning ATMs? what are the others?)**. As a result, the experiences offered by firms have become increasingly critical. However, many enterprises struggle to consider all aspects of customers’ journeys at once. Fortunately, Teradata offers innovative solutions in Vantage and ClearScape Analytics to address these challenges. Teradata’s capabilities provide impactful strategies that companies can utilize to overcome common obstacles and enhance the digital experience.

Customer journeys are imperative to consider in many industries, especially financial based scenarios. 

In this demo, we will consider the important interactions customers have with a retail bank. In Vantage, users can discover new insights across various steps in a customer journey. With these functionalities, users can enhance the financial services customer journey to increase customer acquisition and adoption.

(Reduce above to a sentence or two: the need to look at the whole customer journey: ID the obstacles, enhance the experience. Then, state the sort of analytics used. Maybe summarize high-level steps.)
