# Project flow

You might be the owner of one or more projects and a collaborator on others.

If you create a project, you are its owner. In your company's Git repository that stores project information, the owner of the repository can [add collaborators](/docs/manage-ai-unlimited/add-collaborators.md) to the project. Then in the project notebook, you update the engine for those new users. 

AI Unlimited provides [magic commands](/docs/explore-and-analyze-data/magic-commands.md) (`%magic_command`) for creating and managing projects in your Jupyter notebooks. While project owners and collaborators can use the same magic commands, their project involvement is typically different.
