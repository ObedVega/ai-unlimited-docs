# Project flow

You might be the owner of one or more projects and a collaborator on others.

If you create a project, you are its owner. The owner of your Git repository that stores user and project information can [add collaborators](/docs/manage-ai-unlimited/add-collaborators.md) to the project. Then in the project notebook, you update the engine for those new users. 

AI Unlimited provides [magic commands](/docs/explore-and-analyze-data/magic-commands.md) (`%magic_command`) for creating and managing projects in your Jupyter notebooks. While project owners and collaborators can use the same magic commands, their involvement is typically different. 

Here is the overall project lifecycle from both points of view.
