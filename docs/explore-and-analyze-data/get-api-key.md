# Get your API key

To work on any project, you'll first need to have your [API key.](/docs/glossary#glo-api-key) It connects your Jupyter notebook to the engine. 

1. Use the URL provided by your AI Unlimited admin to access [the manager](/docs/glossary#glo-manager).
:::note
Your AI Unlimited admin is the person at your organization who set up AI Unlimited.

2. Sign in to GitHub or GitLab.
3. After being routed back to the manager, on your **Profile**, copy your API key.

Keep your API key. Or go back to your **Profile** anytime to get it.

Your API key stays the same for the lifetime of the AI Unlimited installation.
