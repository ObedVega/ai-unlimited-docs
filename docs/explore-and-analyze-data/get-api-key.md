# Get your API key

You'll need your API key to connect your Jupyter notebook to the engine. 

After you open a notebook and select the AI Unlimited kernel, you'll provide your API key to a [magic command](/docs/explore-and-analyze-data/magic-commands.md) that configures the connection.

1. Use the URL provided by your AI Unlimited admin to access your user profile.
:::note
Your AI Unlimited admin is the person at your organization who set up AI Unlimited.

2. Sign in, as you normally do, to GitHub or GitLab.
3. On your user profile, copy your API key.
