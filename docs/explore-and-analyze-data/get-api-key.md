# Get your API key

***WIP***

***(Explain what it is, the entities the handshake is between, etc.)***

***(will also tell them how to get it in Create your first project)***

You'll need your API key each time you create a project, or access an existing one, from a Jupyter notebook.

1. Access the AI Unlimited setup using the URL provided to you by your AI Unlim admin: `http://[ip_or_hostname]:[port]`.
:::note
The AI Unlimited admin is the person at your organization who set up AI Unlimited.
:::
2. Sign in, as you normally do to GitHub or GitLab.
3. Go to your **Profile**, and copy your API key.
