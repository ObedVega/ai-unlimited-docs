# Add project collaborators

[placeholder]

***from Artur: User are added to the project by github/gitlab, if users are added before deploy then they are all created automatically as part of the deployment. If users are added there after deploy then %project_engine_update_users need to be used to update and create new users in the deployed engine.***
