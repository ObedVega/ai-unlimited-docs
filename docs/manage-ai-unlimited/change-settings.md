# Change settings (admin)

***WIP***

(Needs 2 separate topics - old UI vs. new UI)

If you are the AI Unlimited admin, you can change AI Unlimited settings. 

(make clear what they can/would change and why)

:::note
The user who [set up AI Unlimited](/docs/install-ai-unlimited/setup-ai-unlimited.md) is the admin.
:::

1. Access the manager ***(more details)***, sign in to your GitHub or GitLab account... how to say that... (will watch recording)
3. Select **Setup**. 
3. In any section, change any values, then select Save Changes. (can they change anything at all?)<br />
[Learn about the fields](/docs/install-ai-inlimited/setup-ai-unlimited).
4. If you've enabled TLS, select **Restart**.<br />
 AI Unlimited restarts with TLS in place.

Go to the **Profile** page to copy your new API Key. (explain why they have a new one & to start using the new one)
