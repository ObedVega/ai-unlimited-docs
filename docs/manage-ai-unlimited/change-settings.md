# Change settings (for administrators)

***WIP***

***Probably needs 2 separate topics - old UI vs. new UI. Will figure that out when I work on Setup.***

In the manager, your administrator can change AI Unlimited settings.
:::note
The administrator is the user who [set up AI Unlimited](/docs/install-ai-unlimted/setup-ai-unlimited.md).
:::

1. Access the manager. ***(more details?)***
2. Authorize ***(will work on wording, b/c "authorize" is a transitive verb - it takes an object - they have to authorize something***) using your GitHub credentials.
3. Select **Setup**. 
3. Change values as needed, and update the section. 
4. If you've enabled TLS, select **Restart** to restart the service ***(what service? we haven't mentioned it before)*** and apply the changes.

Go to the **Profile** page to copy your new API Key.
