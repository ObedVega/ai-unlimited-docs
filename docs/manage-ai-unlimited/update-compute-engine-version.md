# Update the compute engine version

(how-to)

(and what about updates to:

- what we used to call the "workspace service" - will we provide a new Docker image and new cloud templates?

- the kernel - will we provide a new Docker image and new cloud templates if we add/change magic commands? I think it was mentioned that they will be pretty stable though.

- JupyterLab itself, aside from the kernel... will we update the Docker image and cloud templates for the JL version once in a while?

- how will we communicate the updates to users? A What's New link in the header on the doc site?
