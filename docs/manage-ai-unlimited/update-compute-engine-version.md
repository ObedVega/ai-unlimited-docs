# Update the compute engine version

and what about updates to:

- workspace service - we provide a new W Docker image, and new cloud templates (W single and all-in-one)?

- the kernel - we provide a new J Docker image (b/c it includes the kernel), and new cloud templates (J single and all-in-one--because they include the kernel)?

- JupyterLab... if JL is a cloud installation, whether an existing installation or via our cloud template, maybe it gets automatic updates--so not our concern. But if it's running in the Docker container we provided, then do we need to provide a new Docker image with the new JL version?
