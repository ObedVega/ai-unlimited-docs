# Manage projects

Here's what different users can do.

## All users

- Use [magic commands](/docs/explore-and-analyze-data/magic-commands.md) to manage projects in Jupyter notebooks 

- [Suspend and restore projects](/docs/manage-ai-unlimited/suspend-and-resume-project.md) to *pay as you go*

- [Monitor the status](/docs/manage-ai-unlimited/monitor-projects.md) of projects

## Project owners

A user who creates a project is the project's owner.

- [Add collaborators](/docs/manage-ai-unlimited/add-collaborators.md)


## Admin

The user who [set up AI Unlimited](/docs/install-ai-unlimited/setup-ai-unlimited.md) is the admin.

- [Change overall settings](/docs/manage-ai-unlimited/change-settings.md) ***(will explain this better - what does this really mean)***
