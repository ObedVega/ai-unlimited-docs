# Get started

***MEM: Is this content what we need here? Should be in context: What is the user thinking, feeling, and doing when they first arrive here? How did they get here?***

***MEM: The Figma shows similar content on the workspace service UI. How much should go there? Be aware of syncing content between there and here.***

AI Unlimited is a self-service, on-demand platform that enables you to deploy Teradata's compute engine on your cloud service provider and connect it to your data lake.

You deploy the engine only as needed for analytics projects. In a JupyterLab notebook, you use Teradata's [ClearScape Analytics](https://www.teradata.com/platform/clearscape-analytics?) functions to explore and analyze your large-scale datasets. You can suspend your project, then restore it, whenever you want and pay only for the compute resources you use.

***MEM: Somehow, we need to work in a clear distinction between AI Unlimited and ClearScape. The potential for confusion seems significant.***

In all, AI Unlimited has these elements:
- The engine, on your cloud service provider (CSP)
- Jupyter notebooks, with the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel, for running analytic workloads
- Your object storage, on your CSP
- Your GitHub or GitLab repository, for user authentication and storing project information
- A web-based user interface where the administrator user sets up AI Unlimited and monitors projects, and where all users copy their API key for creating projects ***do they need the API key for other things?***
- A command line interface (CLI) for... ***developing automation, etc. - need to understand the specifics better***

***MEM: Overview video: Authentic, technical introduction, educational, not marketing***

***MEM: Can this be the topic from which they choose 1 of the 3 install types? Then remove the (out-of-the-box, generated) category page.***
