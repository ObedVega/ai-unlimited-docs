# Welcome to AI Unlimited

AI Unlimited is a self-service, on-demand platform that enables you to deploy a compute engine and connect it to your data lake. It includes Teradata’s powerful, scalable AI Unlimited compute engine running on the public cloud. AI Unlimited stores no permanent data, which frees you from database management.

You initiate each interaction with AI Unlimited. Meaning, you deploy the engine for an analytics project. Then in a JupyterLab notebook, you use Teradata's ClearScape Analytics [link] to explore and analyze large-scale datasets. You can suspend a project, then restore it, whenever you want to pay only for the compute resources you need.

The AI Unlimited platform has these elements:
- The AI Unlimited compute engine on AWS or Azure
- Your object storage on AWS or Azure
- JupyterLab with the AI Unlimited kerneI, for running workloads in notebooks
- Your GitHub or GitLab repository for storing user and project information, enabling you to restore projects 
- A web-based user interface and a command line interface (CLI) for the AI Unlimited workspace service, which orchestrates the platform’s elements.
