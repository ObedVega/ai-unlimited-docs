# Get started

***MEM: Is this content what we need here? Should be in context: What is the user thinking, feeling, and doing when they first arrive here? How did they get here?***

AI Unlimited is a self-service, on-demand platform that enables you to deploy Teradata's compute engine on your cloud service provider (CSP) and connect it to your data lake. You deploy the engine only as needed for your analytics projects.

In a JupyterLab notebook, you use Teradata's [ClearScape Analytics](https://www.teradata.com/platform/clearscape-analytics?) to explore and analyze your large-scale datasets. You can suspend your project, then resume it, whenever you want and pay only for the compute resources you use.

***MEM: Somehow, we need to work in a clear distinction between AI Unlimited and ClearScape.***

AI Unlimited has these elements:
- The engine, on your cloud service provider (CSP)&mdash;AWS or Azure
- Jupyter notebooks, with the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel, for running analytic workloads
- Your object storage, on your CSP
- Your GitHub or GitLab repository, for user authentication and storing project information
- A web-based user interface where the administrator user monitors projects and all users copy their API key for connecting to the engine ***The purpose of the UI will rapidly evolve. Future-proof this bullet or be specific to PPP?***
- A command line interface (CLI) for... ***developing automation, etc. - need to better understand the specifics***
