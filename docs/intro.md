# Get started

***MEM: Is this content what we need here? Should be in context: What is the user thinking, feeling, and doing when they first arrive here? How did they get here?***

***MEM: Should we include an introductory video here?***

***MEM: The Figma shows similar content on the workspace service UI. How much should go there? Be aware of syncing content between there and here.***

AI Unlimited is a self-service, on-demand platform that enables you to deploy a compute engine and connect it to your data lake. It includes Teradata’s AI Unlimited compute engine running on the public cloud. AI Unlimited stores no permanent data.

You deploy the engine only as needed for analytics projects. In a JupyterLab notebook, you use Teradata's [ClearScape Analytics](https://www.teradata.com/platform/clearscape-analytics?) functions to explore and analyze your large-scale datasets. You can suspend your project, then restore it, whenever you want to pay only for the compute resources you use.

In all, AI Unlimited has these elements:
- The engine, on your cloud service provider (CSP)
- Jupyter notebooks, with the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel, for running analytic workloads
- Your object storage, on your CSP
- Your GitHub or GitLab repository, for user authentication and storing project information
- A web-based user interface and command line interface (CLI) for the AI Unlimited workspace service, which orchestrates the platform’s elements and supports project management tasks 

***MEM: Need to get away from "service" - users care about what they can do, not what makes the product go - UI naming will hopefully change. Not sure users care about what does the "orchestration." They would just assume the elements talk.***

***MEM: Last bullet will probably be like "A web-based project workspace in which an administrator does the setup and can change settings later." Then another bullet for the CLI for deveoping automation, etc. - how to word that?***

***MEM: Can this be the topic from which they choose 1 of the 3 install types? Then remove the (out-of-the-box, generated) category page for them.***
