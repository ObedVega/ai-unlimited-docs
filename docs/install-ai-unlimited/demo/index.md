# Demo installation

To share what AI Unlimited can do with your broader team, use the demo installation.

This puts AI Unlimited and JupyterLab, with the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel, on your cloud service provider (CSP) on the same instance. This is the best setup for showing how the overall system works, while also showing analytics workloads.
