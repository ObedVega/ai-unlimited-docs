# Demo installation

To share with your team what AI Unlimited can do, use the demo installation.

This puts AI Unlimited and JupyterLab, with the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel, on your cloud service provider (CSP) on the same server instance. This is the best setup for showing how the overall system works, while also showing analytics workloads.

As a cloud administrator, or with the help of one, you can complete the installation.  ***Discuss***
