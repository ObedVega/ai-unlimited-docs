# Demo installation

To share with your broader team what AI Unlimited can do, use the **demo installation**.

It puts the AI Unlimited workspace service and JupyterLab, with the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel, on your CSP on the same instance. This is the best setup for showing how the overall system works, while also showing [ClearScape Analytics](https://www.teradata.com/platform/clearscape-analytics?) workloads.

***first para: best to say "cloud" before "instance"? leave it out? some other word? "instance" begs the question "of what?'***
