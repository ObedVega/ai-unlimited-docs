# Set up AI Unlimited

Access the AI Unlimited setup:

- **http://localhost:3000** (if you are using the [QuickStart](/docs/install-ai-unlimited/quickstart/index.md))

- **http://[ip_or_hostname]:[port]** (for a [demo](/docs/install-ai-unlimited/demo/index.md) or [production](/docs/install-ai-unlimited/production/index.md) installation)

:::note
For a demo or production installation, the url might or might not include a port.

Complete the setup. For additional information, click a section below. 

***MEM: The content in the expandable text below will not say anything about "completing fields," "clicking next," etc. We don't need to tell users how to use the UI.***

***The content here is a reference--for when the information users need is too lengthly for the UI. So some (just some) fields will have a "Learn more" link that takes users here.***

***I started to work on the field descriptions for the UI and got sidetracked. That's essential for figuring out which fields need to be in this topic and what to say about them. We'll request a review for this topic separately, understanding that some fields on the UI might still change.***

***This topic will be re-used across the 3 install types.***
