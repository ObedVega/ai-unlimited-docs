# Get engine deployment details

***A version of this for the old UI and new UI?***
  
When you [set up AI Unlimited](/docs/install-ai-unlimited/quickstart/setup-ai-unlimited.md), you'll provide details for deploying the engine on your CSP. 

Copy this template to get these details from someone on your organization's cloud neworking and security team. ***What is the best way to describe this team to this audience? "Cloud IT team?" "Cloud operations team"?*** 
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="aws" label="AWS">
	```bash
	[placeholder]
	```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="azure" label="Azure">
	```bash
	[placeholder]
	```
</TabItem>
</Tabs> 

Or, get these details from your CSP's console.
