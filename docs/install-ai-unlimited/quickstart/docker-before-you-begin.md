# Before you begin

Make sure you have the prerequisites, and take some first steps.

***"first steps" not quite logical in a "Before" topic. Revisit.***

## Prerequisites

- [Cloud service provider (CSP)](/docs/glossary.md#glo-csp) account: [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com). 

- Optionally, your CSP's command-line interface (CLI): [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) or [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli).

- [GitHub](https://github.com) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) account.

- Docker: Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) on your machine. 

## First steps

- Subscribe to AI Unlimited on your CSP's marketplace:  ***If we include this bullet here, we would remove the separate Subscribe topic. Might depend on what we really need to say about subscribing. The listing is going to change still. Hoping it is self-evident.***
  - AWS (link)
  - Azure (link)
  
  
- When you [set up AI Unlimited](/docs/install-ai-unlimited/quickstart/setup-ai-unlimited.md), you'll provide details for deploying the engine on your CSP. Copy this template to get these details from someone on your organization's cloud neworking and security team. ***What is the best way to describe this team to this audience? "Cloud IT team?" "Cloud operations team"?***
