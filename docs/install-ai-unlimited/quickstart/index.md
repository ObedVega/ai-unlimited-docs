# QuickStart

 For the simplest, fastest way to try out AI Unlimited as a single user, use the [QuickStart](link). 
 
 It puts the AI Unlimited workspace service and JupyterLab, with the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel, on your local machine in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers, so you can use [ClearScape Analytics](https://www.teradata.com/platform/clearscape-analytics?) to explore and analyze large data sets locally--right away.
