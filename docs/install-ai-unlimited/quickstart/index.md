# QuickStart

For the simplest, fastest way to try AI Unlimited, use the QuickStart. 
 
This runs AI Unlimited and JupyterLab, with the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel, on your computer using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Then you can use [ClearScape Analytics](https://www.teradata.com/platform/clearscape-analytics?) to explore and analyze large data sets locally&mdash;right away.
