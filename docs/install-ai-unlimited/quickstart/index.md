 This puts AI Unlimited and JupyterLab, with the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel, on your local machine in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers, so you can use [ClearScape Analytics](https://www.teradata.com/platform/clearscape-analytics?) to explore and analyze large data sets locally&mdash;right away.
