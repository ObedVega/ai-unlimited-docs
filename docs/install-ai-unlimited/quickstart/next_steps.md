Now that you've set up AI Unlimited, you can [create your first project](/docs/explore-and-analyze-data/create-first-project.md)!

Or, proceed with any of these steps:
- See the [project lifecycle](/docs/explore-and-analyze-data/project-lifecycle.md), at a glance from beginning to end
- Explore a collection of [example project notebooks](/docs/explore-and-analyze-data/example-projects.md) to find use cases for your industry&mdash;and try them out
- See the [magic commands](/docs/explore-and-analyze-data/magic-commands.md) the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel makes available to your project notebooks
