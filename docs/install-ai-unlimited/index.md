# Get started

***Will be working on the handshake between the marketplace and this page.***

Explore and analyze large datasets in a Jupyter notebook using the Teradata Analytics Library&mdash;on a self-service, on-demand basis. 

As a data scientist or data engineer, connect your notebook to the AI Unlimited AI/ML engine on your [cloud service provider (CSP)](/docs/glossary.md#glo-csp), and connect the engine to your data lake. Suspend and resume your analytics project anytime, and pay only for the hours you use.

The AI Unlimited elements:
- The engine, on your [CSP](/docs/glossary.md#glo-csp)&mdash;AWS or Azure
- Jupyter notebooks, with the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel, for running your workloads
- Your object storage, on your [CSP](/docs/glossary.md#glo-csp)
- Your GitHub or GitLab repository, for user authentication and storing project information
- The manager, a web-based user interface for monitoring projects and providing each user's API key to connect to the engine ***(Normally we avoid "UI" or "user interface" because that's more a dev perspective than a customer perspective. To the customer, it's just [product name]. But here it seems to add the clarity we need.***

Choose a way to start using AI Unlimited:

- [QuickStart](/install-ai-unlimited/quickstart/index.md)&mdash;the fastest way to try it (single user)

- [Full installation](/install-ai-unlimited/production/index.md)&mdash;when your team is ready to begin


***Links in the top bar will likely match the developer's doc site. But we need to add What's New, Blog, Community. Possible to add them only on the AI Unlim "site"?***
