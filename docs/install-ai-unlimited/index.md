# Get started

***Will be working on the handshake between the marketplace and this page.***

Explore and analyze large datasets in a Jupyter notebook using the Teradata Analytics Library&mdash;on a self-service, on-demand basis. 

As a data scientist or data engineer, connect your notebook to the AI Unlimited AI/ML engine on your [cloud service provider (CSP)](/docs/glossary.md#glo-csp), and connect the engine to your data lake. Suspend and resume your analytics project anytime, and pay only for the hours you use.

The AI Unlimited elements:
- The engine, on your [CSP](/docs/glossary.md#glo-csp)&mdash;AWS or Azure
- Jupyter notebooks, with the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel, for running your workloads
- Your object storage, on your [CSP](/docs/glossary.md#glo-csp)
- Your GitHub or GitLab repository, for user authentication and storing project information
- A web-based application for monitoring projects and providing each user with an API key to connect to the engine 

***MEM: Video appears here. An authentic, technical introduction, educational not marketing.***
