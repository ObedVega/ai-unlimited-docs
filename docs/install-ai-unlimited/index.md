# Get started

***MEM: To keep in mind: Does this content pick up from the right context? What is the user thinking, feeling, and doing when they first arrive here? How did they get here?***

***The first sentence should probably convey that this is for data engineers, data scientists, and developers--and what value it enables them to reap (the overall use case).***

AI Unlimited is a self-service, on-demand platform for deploying Teradata's compute engine on your [cloud service provider (CSP)](/docs/glossary.md#glo-csp) and connecting the engine to your data lake. You deploy the engine as needed for your analytics projects.

In a JupyterLab notebook, you use Teradata's [ClearScape Analytics](https://www.teradata.com/platform/clearscape-analytics?) functions to explore your large-scale datasets and experiment with analytics. You can suspend and resume your project, and pay only for the compute resources you use.

The AI Unlimited elements:
- The engine, on your [CSP](/docs/glossary.md#glo-csp)&mdash;AWS or Azure
- Jupyter notebooks, with the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel, for running your workloads
- Your object storage, on your [CSP](/docs/glossary.md#glo-csp)
- Your GitHub or GitLab repository, for user authentication and storing project information
- A web-based application for monitoring projects and providing each user with an API key to connect to the engine 

***MEM: Embed or link to a video: An authentic, technical introduction, educational not marketing***
