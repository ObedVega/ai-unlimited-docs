# Get started

Learn how to deploy and use the [AI Unlimited](https://www.teradata.com/platform/ai-unlimited) AI/ML engine in the cloud.

With AI Unlimited, you can explore and analyze large datasets in a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook using [ClearScape Analytics](https://www.teradata.com/platform/clearscape-analytics) functions&mdash;on a self-service, on-demand basis. 

## How it works

As a data scientist or data engineer, you'll connect your notebook to the AI/ML engine on AWS or Azure, and connect the engine to your data lake. You can suspend and resume your analytics project anytime, and pay only for the hours you use.

In all, AI Unlimited comprises these elements:
- The AI/ML engine, on your AWS or Azure account
- Jupyter notebooks, with the [AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel](https://downloads.teradata.com/download/tools/teradata-ai-unlimited-jupyter-kernel), for running your workloads
- Your object storage, ***how should we describe where it could be?***
- Your Git repository, for authenticating users and storing project information
- A manager, which orchestrates the AI/ML engine's deployment&mdash;and includes a web-based user interface for monitoring projects

:::note
With AI Unlimited you can collaborate on projects with other users. 

If you prefer a single-user approach, try the [QuickStart](/docs/advanced/quickstart) which runs the manager and JupyterLab in Docker containers on your computer.
