# Production installation

Are you ready to scale? Use the production installation to prepare for enterprise use. 

This puts AI Unlimited on your CSP on an instance without JupyterLab. Security and sizing are simpler this way. For the location of JupyterLab, you have these options:

- On your CSP on a separate instance from AI Unlimited:
  - Installed using the AI Unlimited cloud template for JupyterLab, which includes the AI Unlimited kernel 
  - Installed previously, in which case you just need to add the AI Unlimited kernel
- On your computer in a Docker container
- On your computer, but not in a ***Docker?*** container, in which case you need to add the AI Unlimited kernel

***Might they have it, without the kernel, on their computer in a container that's not a Docker container?***

***same "instance" question in the demo install intro applies here***
