# Production installation

Are you ready to scale? Use the **production installation** to prepare for enterprise use. 

This puts the AI Unlimited workspace service on your CSP on an instance without JupyterLab. Security and sizing are simpler this way. For the location of JupyterLab, you then have these options:

- On your CSP on a separate instance from the workspace service:
  - Installed using the AI Unlimited cloud template for JupyterLab, which includes the kernel 
  - Installed previously, in which case you just need to add the kernel
- On your computer in a Docker container
- On your computer, but not in a ***Docker?*** container, in which case you need to add the kernel

***Might they have it, without the kernel, on their computer in a container that's not a Docker container?***
