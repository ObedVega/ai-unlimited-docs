# Full installation

Are you ready to scale to your team? Complete the full installation. 

This puts AI Unlimited on a server instance on your cloud service provider (CSP). 

For your [JupyterLab installation](/docs/install-ai-unlimited/production/AWS/install-jupyter/index.md), you have these options:

- Add the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel to a previous installation of JupyterLab.
- Install JupyterLab with the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel on the same CSP with AI Unlimited, on a separate instance.
- Run JupyterLab with the AI Unlimited Jupyter Kernel on your computer using Docker.

As an admin, or with the help of one, you can complete the installation.  ***Discuss***

Select your CSP:

- [AWS](/install-ai-unlimited/production/AWS/before-you-begin/index.md)
- [Azure](/install-ai-unlimited/production/Azure/before-you-begin/index.md)

***Add something like: For installation support, ask [the Community]. Words TBD.***
