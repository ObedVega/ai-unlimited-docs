# Production installation

Are you ready to scale? Use the production installation to be ready for enterprise use. ***MEM: Roadshow slide says "individuals and small teams." So how about "Is your team ready for AI Unlimited? Use the production installation."***

This puts AI Unlimited on your cloud service provider (CSP) on a server instance without JupyterLab, which simplifies security and sizing. For the JupyterLab location, you have these options:

- On your CSP on a separate instance from AI Unlimited:
  - Installed using the AI Unlimited cloud template for JupyterLab, which includes the AI Unlimited kernel 
  - Installed previously, in which case you just need to add the AI Unlimited kernel
- On your computer in a Docker container
- On your computer, but not in a ***Docker?*** container, in which case you need to add the AI Unlimited kernel

***Might they have it, without the kernel, on their computer in a container that's not a Docker container?***
