# Step 4: Create a custom role with the required permissions	

If you do not have the necessary permissions to create custom roles, you can share the [ai-unlimited](https://github.com/Teradata/ai-unlimited/blob/develop/deployments/azure/policies/ai-unlimited.json) file with your organization administrator. This file contains the subscription-level permissions required for AI Unlimited to deploy AI Unlimited engine instances within your resource groups. Your organization administrator can then create the custom role on your behalf.
