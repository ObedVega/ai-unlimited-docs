# Get deployment details

***A version of this for the old UI and new UI?***
  
When you [set up AI Unlimited](/docs/install-ai-unlimited/production/Azure/prod-azure-setup.md), you'll provide details for deploying AI Unlimited, and potentially JupyterHub, on Azure. 

Copy this template to get these details from someone on your organization's cloud neworking and security team. ***What is the best way to describe this team to this audience? "Cloud IT team?" "Cloud operations team"?*** 

	```bash
	[placeholder]
	```

Or, get these details from the Azure Portal.
