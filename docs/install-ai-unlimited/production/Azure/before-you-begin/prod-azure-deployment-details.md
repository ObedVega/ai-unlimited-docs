# Get deployment details

When you install AI Unlimited on Azure, you'll use an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template, and you'll provide network and security details.

Copy these parameter names to get their values from someone on your organization's cloud neworking and security team. ***What is the best way to describe this team to this audience? "Cloud IT team?" "Cloud operations team"?*** 
  
	```bash
Subscription: 
Region: 
Network:
Subnet: 
Security group:
	```

***I will verify that these are the required parms. Have a feeling I did something during cut-n-paste.***

Or, get these details from the Azure Portal.

***If they install JupyterLab on Azure using our template, will the values for these parms be the same?***
