# Step 3: Create a Resource Group, Network, and Role using ARM Template 

Before you can deploy an AI Unlimited and JupyterLab instances on Azure, you must create an Azure resource group and virtual network (VNet) in which your AI Unlimited engine will run. If you have questions regarding your permissions or the process of creating a resource group or VNet, Teradata recommends consulting your organization administrator. The organization administrator can verify your permissions and help you create the resource group or VNet if needed.
