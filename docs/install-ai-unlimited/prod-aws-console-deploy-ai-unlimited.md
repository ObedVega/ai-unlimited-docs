# Install the manager on AWS

Before you begin, make sure you have the [prerequisites](/docs/install-ai-unlimited/#gs-prerequisties).

The AI Unlimited manager orchestrates the engine's deployment and includes a web-based user interface for monitoring projects. And the manager is where you'll set up AI Unlimited. 

Installing the manager also creates a Git repository for user and project information.

You'll deploy a server instance, on which the manager runs in a container controlled by [systemd](/docs/glossary.md#glo-systemd).

:::tip
For installation support, ask the [community](https://support.teradata.com/community?id=community_forum&sys_id=b0aba91597c329d0e6d2bd8c1253affa).

## Download the manager template

CloudFormation templates for the manager are here in the AI Unlimited GitHub repository you cloned:

`/deployments/aws/templates/ai-unlimited/`

1. Choose a template based on the type of [load balancer](/docs/glossary.md#glo-load-balancer) you want to use.<br /> 
   :::note
   You might want to ask an admin at your organization for guidance.
   :::
    - `ai-unlimited-with-alb.yaml`&mdash;Hosts the manager behind an [application load balancer](/docs/glossary.md#glo-application-load-balancer)
    - `ai-unlimited-with-nlb.yaml`&mdash;Hosts the manager behind a [network load balancer](/docs/glossary.md#glo-network-load-balancer)
    - `ai-unlimited-without-lb.yaml`&mdash;No load balancer. If you're unsure about which template to use, we recommend this one.
2. Download the template.

## Load the template	

1. Sign in to the [AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com).<br />
   :::note
   References to the AWS Console are accurate as of April 11, 2024.
   ::: 
2. Select the AWS region in which to deploy AI Unlimited.<br />
We recommend selecting the region closest to your primary work location.
3. Search for and go to **CloudFormation**.
4. Select **Create Stack**, then **With new resources (standard)**.
5. Select **Choose an existing template**, then **Upload a template file**.
6. Choose the template file you downloaded, and click **Next**.  

## Specify stack details and options

1. Provide a stack name.
2. Review the parameters. Provide values for the required parameters. Your organization might require others.<br />
   :::note
   The parameters for each template vary. You might see some parameters here that you don't see in the console.

| InstanceType | The EC2 instance type that you want to use for the service.<br/>**Required with default**<br/>**Default: t3.small**<br/> |We recommend using the default instance type to save costs. |
| RootVolumeSize | The size of the root disk you want to attach to the instance, in GB.<br/>**Required with default**<br/>**Default: 8**| Supports values between 8 and 1000. |
| TerminationProtection | Enables instance termination protection.<br/>**Required with default**<br/>**Default: false**| |
|IamRole | Specifies whether CloudFormation should create a new IAM role or use an existing one.<br/>**Required with default**<br/>**Default: New**| Supported options are: New or Existing |
|IamRoleName | The name of the IAM role to assign to the instance, either an existing IAM role or a  newly created one.<br/>**Optional with default**<br/>**Default: ai-unlimited-iam-role**| If naming a new IAM role, CloudFormation requires the CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability. Leave this blank to use an autogenerated name. |
|IamPermissionsBoundary	| The ARN of the IAM permissions boundary to associate with the IAM role assigned to the instance.<br/>**Optional**<br/>**Default:NA** | |
|AvailabilityZone | The availability zone to which you want to deploy the instance.<br/>**Required**<br/>**Default: NA**| The value must match the subnet, the zone of any pre-existing volumes, and the instance type must be available in the selected zone. |
|LoadBalancerScheme	|If a load balancer is used, this field specifies whether the instance is accessible from the Internet or only from within the VPC.<br/>**Optional with default**<br/>**Default: Internet-facing**| The DNS name of an Internet-facing load balancer is publicly resolvable to the public IP addresses of the nodes. Therefore, Internet-facing load balancers can route requests from clients over the Internet. The nodes of an internal load balancer have only private IP addresses. The DNS name of an internal load balancer is publicly resolvable to the personal IP addresses of the nodes. Therefore, internal load balancers can route requests from clients with access to the VPC for the load balancer.|
|LoadBalancerSubnetOne | The subnet where the load balancer is hosted. The subnet determines load balancer availability zones, IP addresses, and endpoints.<br/>**Optional with default**<br/>**Default: NA**| You must define a minimum of one available subnet to create a Network Load Balancer (NLB) and two subnets for an Application Load Balancer (ALB).|
| LoadBalancerSubnetTwo| The subnet where the load balancer is hosted.<br/>**Optional. This option is only available in the template with ALB.**<br/>**Default: NA**|This subnet must be in a different availability zone than the first subnet you chose.|
|HostedZoneID | The ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the hosted zone when you created it.<br/>**Optional**<br/>**Default: NA**| Each hosted zone corresponds to a domain name, or possibly a subdomain. The hosted zone is the container for DNS records, where you configure how the world interacts with your domain, such as pointing it to an IP address with a record. On the AWS console, go to **Route 53** > **Hosted zones**. Find your registered domain name and the corresponding Hosted zone ID.|
|DnsName| The name of the domain. For public hosted zones, this is the name you registered with your DNS registrar.<br/>**Optional**<br/>**Default:NA**| For information about how to specify characters other than a-z, 0-9, and - (hyphen) and how to specify internationalized domain names, see [Create Hosted Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_CreateHostedZone.html).|

## Review and create the stack

***Can a tester please provide a screen recording so we can verify these steps?***

1. Review the template settings. 
2. Select the check box to acknowledge that the template will create IAM resources. 
3. Select **Submit** to deploy the stack.<br />
On the **Events** tab, you can monitor progress. When the **Status** is `CREATE_COMPLETE`, the manager is ready. 

The **Outputs** tab shows the values generated for the created resources.

***Does it show the actual url or just the public and private IP addresses?***

You'll need the URL and other values to access the manager and set up AI Unlimited.


## What's next

Access the manager, and [set up AI Unlimited](/docs/install-ai-unlimited/setup-ai-unlimited.md).
