As we continue to enhance AI Unlimited and ensure you are successful in getting started with AI Unlimited, itâ€™s important to understand the limitations. The following features are not supported for this release. Keep an eye on the What's New page for feature enhancements.

- **AI Unlimited Manager**

  ***Insert Content***

- **Open Table Format (OTF)**

  Update and Delete with predicates are not supported for OTF queries.

- **User Defined Functions (UDF)**

  The first invocation of Java UDFs fails with the error `Failure 7583 The secure mode processes had a set up error`.

- **Unbounded Array Framework (UAF)**

  UAF functions are not supported in SQL and teradataml.

- **teradataml**

    - UAF functions fail to run if the database name has special characters, such as hypen (-). 

    - Some SQLE and UAF functions fail to run due to issues with volatile table creation. The framework creates a volatile table if the keyword argument `Volatile` is set to **True**. However, volatile tables can not be created on other schemas.

        - automl
