# AI/ML エンジンのバージョンを更新する

***How to do this***

***And what about updates to:***

***- What we used to call the "workspace service" - will we provide a new Docker image and new cloud templates?***

***- The kernel - will we provide a new Docker image and new cloud templates if we add/change magic commands? I think it was mentioned that they will be pretty stable though.***

***- JupyterLab itself, aside from the kernel... will we update the Docker image and cloud templates for the JL version once in a while?***

***- How will we communicate the updates to users? A What's New link in the header on the doc site?***
